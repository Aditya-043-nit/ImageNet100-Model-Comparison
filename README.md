- **Image Size:** 64√ó64
- **Normalization:** Computed from dataset statistics

## Purpose
- In ResNet, DenseNet and Efficient papers, the models are usually trained on Images with resolution 224*224 or higher but here due to computational limit, I can't train model on my hardware with resolution 224*224, so I observed how all the models will perform on Images with 64*64 resolution.I also tried to train on DenseNet model but due to too many connections/memory limitations, It was difficult to train on my device. Same for more deeper ResNet architectures, as the BottleNeck architecture didn't perform well on 64*64 Images because it was designed for 224*224 images, So It was taking too long to train the ResNet50/101 models.I was expecting performance in the order of EfficientNet> ResNet> VGG19> PlainNet34, but surprisingly VGG19 outperformed all other models.
